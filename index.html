<h1>
  SceneVR
</h1>

<p class='summary'>
  SceneVR was my virtual reality project from 2014-2017. My goal was to create a markup and multiplayer server for social virtual reality experiences on the open web.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  Early versions of Scene had some awesome technology, like webvr support, webrtc for voice chat, a node.js server with collaborative games like chess and competitive pacman, and art galleries generated from reddit albums. We were heavily inspired by <a href="//janusvr.com">JanusVR</a>, and it was awesome when an early version of Janus supported the SceneVR protocol.
</p>

<p>
  In 2015 I released version 1.0.0 of Scene and had a solid but small developer community. In 2016 SceneVR moved into office space with <a href="http://bevr.co.nz/">BeVR</a> in Wellington. I got a HTC Vive and started work on future versions of Scene.
</p>

<p>
  However, the more I spent time in Virtual Reality, the more I discovered I didn't actually enjoy it that much. <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/418650/">Space Pirates</a> is fun for half an hour, <a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/">tiltbrush</a> is a fun way to while away some time, <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/505700/">Anyland</a> is an amazing vision of what might become the metaverse, <a href="https://altvr.com/">Altspace</a> is sort of fun for while, but when I left the VR world, I never had a strong burning desire to re-enter into it.
</p>

<p>
  It wasn't the metaverse I'd dreamed of when reading snowcrash.
</p>

<p>
  As time went on, I came to realise that although I think multiplayer virtual worlds are really exciting, I'm still not convinced the killer app of virtual reality has been created yet.
</p>

<p>
  I hope that it's just early in the VR lifecycle, and there are some amazing and awesome social experiences coming down the pipeline that will connect people like never before.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, I look forward to the future of VR. I won't sell my vive, and I'll keep experimenting
  and trying different ideas, hopefully something will catch and VR will set the world on fire.
</p>

<p>
  But for now, SceneVR is on hiatus. It was a hell of a ride.
</p>

<p>
  All my work on SceneVR has been opensourced and is on <a href="http://github.com/scenevr">github</a>.
